# Root-Cause-Analysis-of-Website-Traffic-Drop
📌 Project Overview
This project performs a diagnostic root cause analysis to identify factors contributing to reduced website traffic using web analytics data. The analysis focuses on SEO performance, page-level engagement, mobile behavior, and technical performance metrics.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, calculated metrics, pivot-based drill-down analysis
Tableau – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

📂 Dataset
Publicly available anonymized web analytics dataset
Metrics include clicks, impressions, CTR, bounce rate, response time, page type, SEO position, and mobile usage

🔎 Analysis Approach
Cleaned and standardized raw web log data in Excel
Created calculated metrics such as CTR and engagement indicators
Performed drill-down analysis using pivot tables across:
Page type (Segments)
SEO position buckets
Mobile vs desktop usage
Response time and internal linking
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize root causes

📈 Key Insights
Pages ranking beyond the top 10 positions show significantly lower CTR despite adequate impressions
Product pages exhibit higher bounce rates and lower engagement compared to catalog pages
Mobile users experience slower response times, leading to increased bounce rates
Weak internal linking limits page discoverability and traffic distribution


✅ Conclusion

The traffic decline is primarily driven by a combination of SEO ranking issues, low click-through efficiency, engagement challenges on product pages, mobile performance bottlenecks, and insufficient internal linking.
